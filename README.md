## **Project Overview**  
This project involves containerizing a CRUD-based MERN stack application to demonstrate DevOps practices, such as containerization and deployment automation. The focus is on breaking down the full-stack architecture into isolated containers, optimizing the code for better performance, and managing version control effectively using GitHub.  

The application provides a seamless user experience for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations, supported by React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for database management.

### **Objective:** 
Containerized a full-stack CRUD-based MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application to streamline deployment and management. Optimized the code and introduced user-friendly changes to enhance the overall experience.

### **Role:**
Led the containerization, code optimization, and repository management processes to ensure efficient deployment and easy maintenance.

### **Technologies and Tools Used:**  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Host OS:** Ubuntu
- **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

### **Key Actions:**  
- Developed Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations to containerize the frontend, backend, and database services.  
- Optimized application code for better performance and scalability while introducing UI/UX improvements for a more user-friendly experience.  
- Built lightweight Docker images and ensured all services functioned seamlessly within containers.  
- Deployed the containerized application on an Ubuntu host and mapped ports to ensure public accessibility.  
- Managed version control through GitHub, documenting changes and ensuring smooth collaboration.  

### **Outcome:** 
- Enhanced application performance through code optimization and improved usability with new features.  
- Simplified deployment by encapsulating the stack into containers, reducing setup time and improving portability.  
- Facilitated collaboration through version control on GitHub, streamlining future updates and issue tracking.
